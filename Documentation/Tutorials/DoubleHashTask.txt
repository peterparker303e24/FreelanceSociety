### Before You Start

You should be completing this tutorial through either the online Sepolia testnet blockchain or the local blockchain. In both cases you are using testnet cryptocurrencies that are freely available, so no value will be lost in testing within the tutorial. Be aware that if you interact with the Sepolia network, the transactions and data you submit are immutable and public, which may affect your privacy.

If you are using the Sepolia network, then you can use the online GitHub hosted Freelance Society website in the link below. But, if you are using a Localhost blockchain or prefer to locally self host the Freelance Society website on your local computer, then you should have the frontend server running and use the Localhost link below.

Localhost Freelance Society website: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

For the Localhost blockchain, you can add the account corresponding to the deployWithData.cjs script with the following private key:

### Add A Double Hash Task

In the Home page, select "Tasks" to navigate to the View Tasks page. In the View Tasks page, you can view the recent hash tasks, double hash tasks, and validator tasks. Each item in the search results lists the common attributes of all types of tasks. The "Hash" is the keccak256 hash of the task ZIP file, the "Manager Address" is the address of the user that created the task, the "Reward" is the amount of Wei the worker receives in completing a task, the "Deadline" is the UTC blockchain timestamp when new worker submissions following this time will no longer be accepted, and the "Task Complete" is the identifier that tells if a worker has completed the task and withdrawn the reward. Select the dropdown arrow and select the "Add Double Hash Task" button to navigate to the Add Double Hash Task page.

The "Hash Value" is the keccak256 hash of some 32 bytes that is the keccak256 hash of some secret 32 bytes. The secret 32 bytes should be obtained by the worker by following the description in the task requirements. For this tutorial, the secret 32 bytes is the keccak256 hash of the UTF-8 encoded value "2" which results in the Hash Key "0xad7c5bef027816a800da1736444fb58a807ef4c9603b7848673f7e3a68eb14a5" and First Hash "0x1204b3dcd975ba0a68eafbf4d2ca0d13cc7b5e3709749c1dc36e6e74934270b3". In the "Hash Value" input:

###
    0x1c45d96fec31449eec463a618003378fb419a566a7c56ce7e6053c5aaa01e466

The "Task Hash" is the keccak256 hash of the Task.zip file data. It is immutably written to the blockchain to authenticate that any manager, worker, or validator users are communicating using the exact same task. In the "Task Hash" input:

###
    "0x22e5594e977f215c69be7c0bd8254a0fe8a61e21014e11ebceb97ed17695952b"

The "Seconds Until Deadline" is the dedicated time in seconds that workers have to complete the task starting from the task creation time. Note that the blockchain may not have accurate timestamping. But, there are protocols in place to reduce inaccuracies in the blockchain timestamps, so the time is not entirely unreliable. In the "Seconds Until Deadline" input 1 weeks worth of seconds:

###
    604800

The "Key Reveal" determines whether the task manager must reveal the Hash Key to withdraw their funds in the event that no user completes the task before the deadline. When this value is true, it incentivizes the manager that created the task to reveal the solution to the task which can build trust with other users that the manager creates reasonable tasks. Keep this toggle as "ON".

The "Second Response Window" is the unique timespan, in seconds, that a worker has to submit their second response to confirm the task completion. The purpose for the two responses in the double hash task is to allow for a dedicated time window for a worker to submit the First Hash of the secret bytes, so other users cannot frontrun transactions when the new information is revealed. Only the worker that solved the task knows the secret Hash Key, and so they are the only worker that can confirm the task in the second response time window. Any users that frontrun the transaction of the First Hash do not know the Hash Key, and so cannot confirm the task during their dedicated time window. In the "Second Response Window" input:

###
    180

The "Second Response Delay" is the minimum time, in seconds, that the start of the second response window may begin from the blockchain timestamp when the user submitted their first response. This delay is useful to allow a greater confirmation time for their first response transaction on the blockchain. In the "Second Response Delay" input:

###
    20

The "Reward" is the amount of cryptocurrency, in Wei, that is sent to the worker that completes the task. The manager inputs an initial reward to incentivize workers to complete the task. Other users can add funds to the task, even repeatedly. The reward to the worker is the sum of all users funding amounts. In the "Reward" input:

###
    1000000000000000

The checkbox with text "I have have read the ethics requirements and my submission does not violate any of the ethics requirements." checks that the user acknowledges that they have not violated any ethics in the process of creating the task. Select the checkbox so that is displays the checked symbol.

This upload will automatically set the "Task Hash" input value so it matches the actual Task.zip file keccak256 hash. The ZIP file should be uploaded within your base route with the path "Tasks/HashTasks/22e5594e977f215c69be7c0bd8254a0fe8a61e21014e11ebceb97ed17695952b/Task.zip".

With all task data input set, the "Add Hash Task" button will now be enabled. Select this button and confirm the transaction to add the hash task to the blockchain. You will be redirected to the View Tasks page and the recent tasks will shortly populate the page. Select "View Task" with the task that has the matching "Manager Address" of your account. You will be redirected to the Hash Task page where you can view the task blockchain data, add funds to the task reward, withdraw funds of an incomplete task, and view the task data conditions. You can now use this newly created task for completion.

### Complete The Double Hash Task

In the Home page, select "Tasks" to navigate to the View Tasks page.

The recent tasks will populate the page. Navigate to a double hash task by selecting the "View Task" button of a task with the "dh-" shortname prefix.

View the blockchain task data displayed on the page. The goal in completing the task is to find a 32 byte value that when hashed with keccak256 and the hashed again with keccak256 results in the "Hash Value". The instructions to find this value should be described in the task specifications. Scroll down and discover the task data. You can select the "Auto Discover Task" button to automatically iterate through users to see if they host the data you are searching for by matching the Task Hash. Select "Skip Address" to iterate to the next user, and if you reach the end of the users iteration, then select "Auto Discover Task" to restart the search. Select the "Try Download from..." button to try downloading the task from the user shown at the URL shown. Once the task has been discovered, you can view the task folder contents in the file tree display to the right. You can also select "Save Locally" once the data has been discovered to download the ZIP file to your computer to view all of the contents in the task. Now select "Submit Task" to navigate to the Submit Double Hash Task page.

Once you have completed the instructions in the task description, you should have found a 32 byte hash key. If you are using the task from the previous section, then use the hash key value:

###
    "0xad7c5bef027816a800da1736444fb58a807ef4c9603b7848673f7e3a68eb14a5"

Input the hash key in the "Hash Key Input" field. Its keccak256 first hash and keccak256 second hash will automatically be checked against its expected hash value. Select the "Submit First Hash" button and confirm the transaction to submit the first hash transaction.

If the transaction is successful, the page will refresh and the second response window will be shown in the data below. Wait until the current time is between the second response window start time and end time. The page should reload with the same hash key input data, but if not, then input the same data in the hash key as above. Select "Submit Hash Key" and confirm the transaction to confirm the task completion.

If this second transaction is successful, you will recieve the reward from the task and the task will be marked as complete.

### What To Do Next
