[Access Freelance Society Here](https://peterparker303e24.github.io/Base/TheDarkKnight/Frontend/index.html) (Requires blockchain wallet extension such as MetaMask for interactions)

This project is currently built on the Ethereum testnet, Sepolia. This testnet does not require any payment since the Sepolia cryptocurrency can be freely accessed with faucets through websites such as in the link below. Also, a wallet browser extension is required, such as MetaMask, though this is also free to install.

## What Is Freelance Society

Freelance Society is a decentralized free market platform to provide efficient transactions of labor and capital.

- **Decentralized**: Blockchains are a decentralized network of nodes that democratize control of transactions. This means there is no centralized authority that has the power to censor transactions, manipulate supply of currency, or invade the privacy of participants. Freelance Society adds a layer of decentralization for labor. The Ethereum blockchain technology has smart contracts that can be utilized to facilitate the transaction of capital and labor. Freelance Society aims to maintain values of existing decentralized technology by eliminating censorship of labor opportunities and respecting users' privacy. Freelance Society is decentralized because it builds upon the decentralized blockchain technology and decentralizes the market of capital providers and workers.
- **Free Market**: A free market system of capital and labor is when capital providers and workers both have the greatest freedom to choose how to spend their resources. Freelance Society provides an improved free market because capital providers have greater opportunity to efficient labor and workers have greater freedom to work opportunities. Additionally, both capital providers and workers have greater freedom of privacy which does not exist in the labor market.
- **Platform**: Freelance Society is a platform to connect users with capital (in search of labor) to workers (in search of capital). Freelance Society aims to connect users through an accesssible interface with tools for all users to optimize the efficiency of their interactions.
- **Efficient Transactions**: Transactions of capital and labor are efficient when the incentive structures in place are optimized for both capital providers and workers. Existing labor markets are failing to provide efficient transactions of labor and capital because those with power are corrupting the market structures to maintain and grow their power. Freelance Society aims to provide efficient transactions by producing incentive structures that provide to users' needs, decentralize power, and outcompete the corrupted market structures. Freelance Society focuses on the transaction of digital goods and services that can be shared throughout the internet. Continue to the section [Why Use Freelance Society](#why-use-freelance-society) to learn how Freelance Society may be beneficial to you whether you are looking for capital or for work. 

## Why Use Freelance Society

Whether you are a user in need of labor or a user searching for work opportunities, Freelance Society allows anyone to participate. Since anybody can participate, the labor pool is competitive, which brings great efficiency. Also, since users can be anonymous, the rewards for workers in completing tasks is based entirely on merit. Users' opportunities for work do not depend on unfair business practices such as discrimination, nepotism, or extensive interview processes. Additionally, workers are free to choose which tasks to spend their time on, choose what compensation they are willing to work towards, and choose how they want to accomplish a task.

Freelance Society is unique among other freelance work platforms because it utilizes features of blockchain technology in advantageous ways. Blockchains are decentralized, so there is no central organization that takes a cut out of transactions. Blockchains are immutable, so the transaction history of all users is fully auditable which incentivizes building trust between users. Blockchains allow users to transact anonymously, so users are able to maintain their freedom of privacy. Blockchains are openly accessible to anyone with an internet connection, so anyone has the opportunity to participate in the free market.

## Tutorial

## Closing Remarks

This project is currently in beta testing to allow for participation from anyone, but may also have bugs since it has not been widely tested. However, the Sepolia blockchain is a testnet, so no valuable cryptocurrency will be lost. Though, if you also have a mainnet Ethereum wallet, then you may still want to make sure you separate the wallets and accounts as much as possible so you do not accidentally mix up transactions between the blockchains or leak any seeds.

Freelance Society interacts with online cryptocurrencies with freedom of privacy and anonymity. This incentivizes attacks from hackers on this platform, so contributions to this project should be taken slowly and with caution.
